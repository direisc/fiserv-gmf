# fiserv GMF

Work with XML and XSD on Node.js are not easy, and integrate with fiserv require XML messages.

To work with XML and XSD files I founded a helpful library called [cxsd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cxsd) and decided to create on library to be help with generated requests like using languages with classes.

## How generate new classes

The library cxsd require xsd from a server, and we have local files to work.

For solve this we need to provider schemas we need to parser on `schema` folder and run `pnpm schema` to server this static files.

To generate one builded version we can run:

`pnpm cxsd http://127.0.0.1:8080/gmfV12.04.xsd`

After that we need to provide correct information on `recommended.d.ts` and on `exports` inside the package.json

## Example

```typescript
import {
  GMFMessageVariants,
  CreditRequestDetails,
  CommonGrp,
  CardGrp,
  AddtlAmtGrp,
  EcommGrp,
  CustInfoGrp,

  // utils
  cleanUpInterface,
  mountResponse,
} from 'fiserv-gmf'
import { REQUEST_TPPID, REQUEST_TERMID, REQUEST_MERCHID, REQUEST_GROUPID } from './Constants'

import { XMLBuilder } from 'fast-xml-parser'

// CreditRequest
export const creditRequest: GMFMessageVariants = {
  CreditRequest: {
    /* Assigning value to the objects
     * This class CommonGrp is generated from XSD file.
     * Transaction elements inside this common group will be present to all transactions.
     * Assign the Common Group object to the property of CreditSaleRequest
     * object
